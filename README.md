# Project-1
Create a game
"Escape the Wizard's Keep"
Player has escaped from a cell in the Wizard's lab. He must now escape the keep.





Simple Canvas Game.
Object of the game is to move player to the other end of the screen without touch any traps or guards called "Grues." Touching a trap or a guard will send player back to the starting point. Player has 2 minutes to get out of the keep.

Player will be released from cell at the beginning of the game with other prisoners. These will be his "lives." Upon the loss of a life, a message will prompt that one of the player's companions has died. There will be a funny message text when this occurs. Every time he loses a life (touching a trap or Grue), he will reurn to the start of the game.

There will be a collision event to exit the first room which will prompt a trivia question. A user input box will populate. Any response will be the correct answer for the questions, except for one random question that will be asked the second time this occurs (player has lost a life and has to start over). Q1, what is your name. Q2 what is your favorite color? Q3 What is your favorite holiday?  The random question ( on try #2) will be similar to the bridge keeper in Holy Grail.. what is he average speed of a swallow...etc " Incorrectly answering this will send player back to start. Will need to figure out how to code looking for a specific response to last (swallow question) question, though it will only be asked once. 

room 2 has a simple moving wall that player must avoid.

room 3 has a Grue who will move randomly within a set of coordinates. He will move slow.

room 3 has 2 moving walls

room 4 has 2 random moving Grues

You win he game when player touches far end of screen.

Will have walls to create rooms. 

There will be a countdown timer of 2 minutes. Game will end when timer expires (Wizard has returned to his keep).
